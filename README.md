## About  
Hello, I'm Matt. I have a background in information technology and data analysis, and I earned my M.S. in Data Analytics and Information Systems from Texas State University in Spring 2025. I currently work as a Senior IT Business Systems Analyst for an energy utility in Austin, TX. I'm interested in additional opportunities to apply my analytical skills to uncover insights and support data-driven decision making. 

This is a repository demonstrating some of my data analytics, database management, and visualization work.
