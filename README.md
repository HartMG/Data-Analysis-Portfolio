## About  
Hello, I'm Matt. I have a background in information technology, data analysis, and earned my M.S. in Data Analytics and Information Systems from Texas State University in spring 2025. I currently work as a Senior IT Business Systems Analyst for an energy utility in Austin, TX, and I am excited to put my analytical skills to use uncovering insights and guiding business decision making. 

This is a repository demonstrating some of my data analytics, database management, and visualization work.
