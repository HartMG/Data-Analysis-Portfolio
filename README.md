## About  
Hello, I'm Matt. I have a background in information technology and data analysis, and I earned my M.S. in Data Analytics and Information Systems from Texas State University in Spring 2025. I currently work as a Senior IT Business Systems Analyst for an energy utility in Austin, TX. I'm interested in additional opportunities to apply my analytical skills to uncover insights and support data-driven decision making. 

This is a repository demonstrating some of my data analytics, database management, and visualization work. 

## Portfolio Projects
### Python: Analyzing and Predicting Electricity Prices in Houston, TX
<strong>Code:</strong> [Electricity Price Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/HartMG/HartMG/blob/main/ElectricityAnalysis.ipynb)

<strong>Overview:</strong> This Python code demonstrates my process of cleaning, analyzing (EDA), cross validating, and forecasting electricity prices in Houston, TX based on Consumer Price Index data from January 1979 through August 2024. 

<strong>Technology:</strong> Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, Statsmodels

<strong>Data source:</strong> Data was exported from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm) website. [Download my data export](https://github.com/HartMG/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Houston_Electricity_Data.xlsx) to test and practice with my code.  

### SQL: Cleaning, Normalization, and Insights with Superstore Dataset
<strong>Code:</strong> [Superstore Database.SQL](https://github.com/HartMG/HartMG/blob/main/superstore_db.sql)

<strong>Overview:</strong> This SQL project demonstrates my query and analytics techniques using a Superstore dataset. Techniques include data cleaning, normalization, aggregation, filtering, and business insights.

<strong>Technology:</strong> SQLite, Python (for converting CSV to DB)

<strong>Data source:</strong> Data was exported from Kaggle's [Global Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/global-superstore-dataset). I modified the order date and ship date columns for this project since they had non-varying values. I then converted the CSV to a DB file using a [Python script](https://github.com/HartMG/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/superstore.ipynb). [Download my data export](https://github.com/HartMG/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/superstore-MH.csv) to test and practice my SQL.
